"""
HTTP routes.

The request body is read and validated inside the handler rather than through
a typed signature. That is deliberate: the framework would otherwise consume
and parse the body before the handler runs, which would bypass the audit trail,
answer an unauthenticated caller with a schema complaint instead of a refusal,
and buffer an arbitrarily large payload before anyone had a chance to object.
Authorization is decided first, the body is then read under a size ceiling, and
every rejection still produces an audit record.
