"""
Request workflow: validate, pre-check, execute, audit, respond.

This is where the pieces are sequenced. Every path through it -- including
every rejection -- ends in exactly one audit record, so a request that was
refused is as traceable as one that succeeded.

The ordering deviates from the obvious "check the budget first" in one place:
a differential privacy request's budget cost lives in its parameters, so those
parameters have to be validated before the budget can be checked against them.
Validating first also means a malformed request never touches budget state.
